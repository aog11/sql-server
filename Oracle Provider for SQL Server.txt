Special thanks to SomeGuy for the answer in the serverfault site! Link below:
https://serverfault.com/questions/175257/how-to-install-oracle-ole-drivers-for-use-in-sql-server-2008-r2-x64

1.  Download 32 and 64-bit clients from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html (click "see all" to see different versions, otherwise, you'll be downloading the complete Oracle program. Your downloads should be about 600 meg each)
2.  Run 32-Bit install on the SQL Server. Select "Custom"
3.  For Oracle Base, enter "C:\Oracle"
4.  For "Software Location", change to C:\Oracle\product\11.2.0\client_32
5.  Choose the following components:
	- SQL*Plus
	- Oracle Call Interface (OCI)
	- Oracle Net
	- Oracle Services for Microsoft Transaction Server
	- Oracle Administration Assistant for Windows
	- Oracle Provider for OLE DB
	- Oracle Data Provider for .NET
	- Oracle Providers for ASP.NET
6.  Repeat above steps with the 64-bit installer. HOWEVER, change the "Software Location" to C:\Oracle\product\11.2.0\client_64
	I got a memory error at this point, but chose to ignore it since I know there is enough
	Ignore the error "OracleMTSRecoveryService already exists"
Now that the install is done, just need to tweak a few things.
7.  Make registry changes to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDTC\MTxOCI
	- OracleOciLib should be oci.dll
	- OracleSqlLib should be orasql11.dll
	- OracleXaLib should be oraclient11.dll
8.  Make same registry changes to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSDTC\MTxOCI
9.  Create or copy a new tnsnames.ora in C:\Oracle\product\11.2.0\client_32\network\admin
10. Create or copy a new tnsnames.ora in C:\Oracle\product\11.2.0\client_64\network\admin
11. Reboot!

You should now see OraOLEDB.Oracle as a provider under Linked Servers\Providers in SSMS
Right-click this provider, then Properties, then tick the box for "Allow Inprocess"
You can now create linked server through the GUI or T-SQL

***Next Steps***
12. Add the lines below to the indicated files in both the x32 and x64 locations of the Oracle Client
      To sqlnet.ora:
	NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH= (TNSNAMES, HOSTNAME)
	SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME = 30
      To tnsnames.ora
	---The service name entry for the target database, for example:
PRODB =
 (DESCRIPTION =
   (ADDRESS_LIST =
     (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.0.0.90)(PORT = 1521))
   )
   (CONNECT_DATA =
     (SERVER = DEDICATED)
     (SERVICE_NAME = prodb)
   )
 )

13. Create the linked server through SSMS or T-SQL following the example in oracleLinkedServer.sql and

14. Test the linked server with a query
SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY([MARS.ANTONI.COM] , 'select sysdate from dual');
If you get a result, congrats, it's done! :)
