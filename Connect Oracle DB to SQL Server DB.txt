1. Download and install de Oracle Gateways utility in the file p13390677_112040_Linux-x86-64_5of7, during the
installation process install de "Oracle Database Gateway for Microsoft SQL Server" component.

2. Add the following entry to the listener.ora file located in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin, remember to replace the mentioned
paths in ORACLE_HOME and ENVS for the ones you currently are using and to backup the file before proceeding.
SID_LIST_LISTENER=
  (SID_LIST=
    (SID_DESC=
     (SID_NAME=dg4msql)
     (ORACLE_HOME=/opt/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/)
     (PROGRAM=dg4msql)
     (ENVS="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/dg4msql/driver/lib:/opt/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/lib")
    )
  )

3. Restart the listener.
	- lsnrctl stop
	- lsnrctl start

4. Add the following entry in the tnsnames.ora file located in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin, remember to backup the file before proceeding.
dg4msql =
  (DESCRIPTION=
    (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=mars.antoni.com)(PORT=1521))
      (CONNECT_DATA=(SID=dg4msql))
      (HS=OK)
  )

5. Verify that the entry in tnsnames.ora works.
	- tnsping dg4msql
The response should look like the text below:
Used TNSNAMES adapter to resolve the alias
Attempting to contact (DESCRIPTION= (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=mars.antoni.com)(PORT=1521)) (CONNECT_DATA=(SID=dg4msql)) (HS=OK))
OK (10 msec)

6. Create the database link with the recent entry in tnsnames.
CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK SQLTEST CONNECT TO [USER/LOGIN] IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWD] USING 'dg4msql';

Done :)

Notes:
1. You can find the database and server specified during the Gateways installation in the initdg4msql.ora file 
   located in $ORACLE_HOME/dg4msql/admin.
2. In order to change the database used in the connection, edit the HS_FDS_CONNECT_INFO parameter in initdg4msql.ora
   with the desired database and recreate the DBLINK to see the changes.
