After the installation of the SQL Server if we want to connect remotely to the database, we need to:

1. Configure the TCP/IP protocol on SQL Server Configuration Manager to "Enabled" and in the IP Addresses tab of its properties
set TCP Dynamic to NULL and TCP Port to 1433 (SQL Sever's default port).

2. Create two inboud rules on the firewall:
  2.1 One that allows connections to the 1433 port through the TCP protocol.
  2.2 Another one that allows connections to the 1434 port through the UDP protocol.

In order to ping a server by IP and Hostname, in Windows Server, we need to create two inboud rules
that allow traffic through the protocols ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

The equivalent of TRUNC to a date and the TO_DATE function in SQL Server:

convert(date,create_date,105) -- Truncates the date, removes hour, seconds, etc.
convert(date,'26-03-2020',105) -- Turns a string into a date in the YYYY/MM/DD format.

select * from sys.all_objects
where convert(date,create_date,105) = convert(date,'26-03-2020',105);
